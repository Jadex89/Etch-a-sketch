# Etch-a-sketch

Assignment is from The Odin Project and is to create a programme of Etch-a-Sketch.

My version utilises a default grid and also an option for the user to select a grid size.
There is a clear/reset button, a random colour/rainbow button and a shading button to customise the colouring.

The programme is created using html, css and javascript.
